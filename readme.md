# Hello Programming
Making a website requires the following three programming languages!
### HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
Helps us control the structure of text. 

Looking at the following, how do you know what a pagragraph is, how do you know what a sentence is, how do you know what a link is??
```html
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML
```
```html
<div class="pagaraph" id="first">
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML Wiki Page!</a>
</div>
<div class="pagaraph" id="second">
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML Wiki Page!</a>
</div>
```
### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
Helps us style web pages.

Now that we have a way of structuring titles, sentences, paragraphs, links, etc with HTML we can refer to them to style them.
```css
body: {
    background-color: orange;
}

.paragraph {
    background-color: dodgerblue
}

#second {
    font-weight: bold;
    color: violet;
}
```
### JS (JavaScript)
